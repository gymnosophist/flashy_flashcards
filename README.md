# Text parser

## Purpose and scope

The goal of this project is to create an easy interface for creating Anki flashcards based on any (Greek) text found in the Perseus digital library. This objective is accomplished via the TextParser class, which has methods to explore the available corpus, generate a word list, parse the LSJ, and create and export Anki flashcards.

## Requirements

There are several libraries required, and several pieces of outside data.

### Package requirements

pandas == 1.0.4
xml.etree.ElementTree == 1.3.0
glob == 0.7
genanki == 0.8
tqdm == 4.47.0

### Data requirements

The module requries access to the Lemmatized Ancient Greek and LSJ Unicode github repos, available at [this repo](https://github.com/gcelano). Credit to Giuseppe G. A. Celano for these data.

## Operation

Clone the repo, then import pharr.py. Initialize the class TextParser().

### Example usage

```python

import pharr.py

parser = TextParser()

parser.catalog.sample(1, random_state = 123).urn.values[0]

parser.get_text(urn = 'urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2200.tlg00445.opp-grc1') # Libanius, Orationes XXVI-L

parser.add_word_definitions() # creates dictionary

parser.make_flashcards('libanius_vocab') # output in working directory
